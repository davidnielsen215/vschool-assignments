            <h1>ABOUT TIE MASTER</h1>
            <p>Finding high-quality, wallet-friendly menswear shouldn’t be so difficult. 
                That’s why we founded Tie Master. 
                By working hand-in-hand with our manufacturers and engaging customers directly, 
                we’re able to deliver superior quality products 
                and explore creative ways to add value. 
                We obsess over the details so you don’t have to.</p>
            <p>We have real humans answering phones, we gingerly pack our boxes by hand, and we’re here for you every step of the way. That’s the real reason our customers keep coming back year after year. In a world of automation, we believe a human touch makes all the difference.</p>
            <p>It all began in a tiny one room office in the heart of Orange County, California. Our space was small, but our dreams were larger than life. Despite it’s humble beginnings, Ties.com has grown into the world’s premier men’s accessory company. Through it all, we’ve stayed true to original ambition: Deliver the best shopping experience anywhere online.</p>
